From first glace at the first chart, it is evident that theater was the most common type of Kickstarter campaign during this eight year period across the 21 countries from which data was collected. Theater had the largest number of successful campaigns, but also the largest number of failed campaigns. The second and chart shows that Plays, a subcategory of Theater, were the most common type of campaign. As shown in the third chart, plays were also successful more often than not.
