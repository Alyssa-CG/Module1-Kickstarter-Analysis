# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

Data from 4114 Kickstarter campaigns from 2009 to 2017 was analysed to help improve the likelihood of success for future campaigns. First, we considered outcome based on the type or category of Kickstarter campaign, as illustrated by the following stacked bar chart.

At first glace it is evident that theater was the most common type of Kickstarter campaign during this eight year period across the 21 countries from which data was collected. Theater had the largest number of successful campaigns, but also the largest number of failed campaigns, so more data must be evaluated before proceeding.

This second and chart shows that Plays, a subcategory of Theater, were the most common type of campaign. As shown in the following chart, plays were also successful more often than not.
