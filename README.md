# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

Data from 4114 Kickstarter campaigns from 2009 to 2017 was analysed to help improve the likelihood of success for future campaigns. First, we considered outcomes, as shown in the charts below.

From first glace, it is evident that theater was the most common type of Kickstarter campaign during this eight year period across the 21 countries from which data was collected. Theater had the largest number of successful campaigns, but also the largest number of failed campaigns, which warrants further analysis.

 The second and chart shows that Plays, a subcategory of Theater, were the most common type of campaign. As shown in the following chart, plays were also successful more often than not.

This alone does not give enough information, so month of launch and goal and pledge amounts were evaluated for the Kickstarter campaigns.

After evaluating the data, I would recommend that if a play is selected for a Kickstarter campaign it be launched in May, which appears to be correlated with the highest successes. Target goal amount should also be both worthwhile and realistic, so it may be worth considering what past values were successful in different regions. Other factors must be considered when planning the kickstarter campaign however, such as the state of the economy (recession or even pandemic versus boom), how the campaign will be promoted (sponsors, spokespersons etc) and where the initial resources (money, manpower) will come from.
